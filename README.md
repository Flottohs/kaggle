My notes from Kaggle are simply my own saved copy of the course, so I can quickly refer back to the material. I have no intention of distributing it or presenting it as my own work. I am using it strictly for personal learning, and I am not engaging in any form of plagiarism.

For any functions that appear to call strings, they are not actually strings in my notes. They represent variables that I have not defined yet because I have not downloaded the required resources. I do this intentionally so my editor does not show warnings about undefined references.

The same applies to any outputs I place in quotation marks.
